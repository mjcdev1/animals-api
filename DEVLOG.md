# Development Log

### Development Update #1 - 7/29/2024
Development has officially begun and been in progress for the past couple of weeks.
At this point, we've established a starting database to store animals in. We have API endpoints to both add animals to the database
and to retrieve them, as well as scripts to call those endpoints. On the frontend, the current build of the Flutter code includes 
a nice welcome screen that leads into the main UI. The main UI currently features a bottom AppBar with (working) icon buttons for 
all of the intended app pages. We have also implemented the Google Maps API to show on the map page and it is working, but with some quirks.
